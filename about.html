            <h2>Why am I interested in coding?</h2>
            <p>I first encountered programming in high school, strating with Scratch, then moving on to Visual Basic, Java, and full stack development including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL.
            Since then I was always intrigued by Computer Science, and the abillity to create helpful programs and automate certain things, making some tedious jobs much easier. </p>
